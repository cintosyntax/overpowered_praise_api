# Overpowered Praise API

A ridiculous API that serves insane compliments. This utilizes the Internet Chuck Norris Database (http://www.icndb.com/) API as a foundation. This API proxies the call and replaces the name of 'Chuck Norris' to the input provided by the user.

## Wish list
- Build a seperate Go package that handles API calls to ICNDB.
- Clean up the structure and add version controlling to the service.
- Build a slack friendly endpoint mode.
